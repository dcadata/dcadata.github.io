## Functions/How to Use:

* On main (1st) sheet, enter up to 4 names of interest in the yellow cells (in row 4)
  * Scroll down to look at year-by-year popularity and gender trends

* *MostNeutralByYear* (2nd sheet) calculates the most gender-neutral names for a given birth year.

* Don't make changes to *Data* and *Pivot* - these sheets contain the underlying data the other sheets rely on

## Notes:

* Uses United States Social Security Administration (SSA) data [publicly available from SSA.gov](http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/index.html)

* Years 1960 to present. Uses even years only. (Using all years made for sluggish calculations.)

* Per the SSA, "All names are from Social Security card applications for births that occurred in the United States."
  * Does not include data from name changes or from immigrants to the US

* SSA provides only the top 1000 names for each year, which account for ~75% of recorded births, so this tool can't display trends for the remaining ~25% rarest names.
